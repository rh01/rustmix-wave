# Rustmix Wave user guide

This guide describes the Rustmix Wave v1.0.0 user interface as shown by the reference screenshots under [`/screenshots`](../screenshots/). The firmware targets the Waveshare ESP32-S3 3.97-inch e-paper board and uses a rotary-first interaction model.

## Physical controls

| Control | Normal behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Rotary up / down | Move the highlighted row, change a value, turn a reader page, or move within the active keyboard axis |
| Rotary SELECT | Open the highlighted item, activate an action, or advance an editor field |
| BOOT short | Contextual secondary action. On grid keyboards it toggles `NAV H` / `NAV V`. In Calendar it opens the daily agenda or creates a personal event from the agenda. In Sudoku and Minesweeper it toggles the active movement axis or cancels an edit/action mode. |
| BOOT long | Hierarchical Back. On editors it cancels and returns without saving. |
| Power short | Open the display-maintenance menu. Select **Clear ghosting now** for a full e-paper base refresh, or select **Cancel**. |
| Power long | Enter random sleep-image mode. After the wake guard quiet interval, press Power briefly to restore the previous screen. |

The bottom footer on each screen repeats the controls that are valid in that context.

## 1. Home dashboard

<img src="../screenshots/homepage.jpg" width="360" alt="Rustmix Wave home dashboard">

The home dashboard shows date, time, battery, weather summary, Wi-Fi state, and the five top-level categories.

| Row | Opens |
| --- | --- |
| Reader | Continue Reading, Library, and Bookmarks |
| Productivity | Calendar and Voice Notes |
| Games | SD-loaded apps backed by native Rust game surfaces |
| Tools | File Browser, Dictionary, and Unit Converter |

### Dictionary

<table>
<tr><td><img src="../screenshots/dictionary.jpg" width="300" alt="Dictionary search"></td><td><img src="../screenshots/dictionary-result.jpg" width="300" alt="Dictionary result"></td></tr>
</table>

The native Dictionary reuses the X4 prefix-shard SD pack. Enter letters, use **GO** for exact lookup with prefix fallback, or use `*` for prefix lookup and repeated result cycling.

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Rotary up / down | Move within active keyboard axis |
| BOOT short | Toggle `NAV H` / `NAV V` |
| SELECT | Activate letter, DEL, CLR, GO, or `*` |
| BOOT long | Return to Tools |

### Unit Converter

<table>
<tr><td><img src="../screenshots/unit-converter.jpg" width="300" alt="Unit converter length"></td><td><img src="../screenshots/unit-converter1.jpg" width="300" alt="Unit converter volume"></td></tr>

Navigation: rotate through actions, SELECT to run, hold BOOT to return.

### Clock and RTC details

<table>
<tr><td><img src="../screenshots/clock.jpg" width="300" alt="Clock overview"></td><td><img src="../screenshots/rtc-details.jpg" width="300" alt="RTC details"></td></tr>
</table>

Clock shows localized RTC time, temperature, humidity, battery, USB, and charge status. RTC Details shows time basis, storage basis, battery voltage, USB state, charge state, and refresh policy.

Navigation: SELECT opens details; hold BOOT returns.

### Display

<img src="../screenshots/display.jpg" width="360" alt="Display preferences">

Display settings change the global UI font and UI size. Rotate to choose a row, SELECT to change, and hold BOOT to return.

### Device Info

<table>
<tr><td><img src="../screenshots/device-info.jpg" width="260" alt="Device info firmware page"></td><td><img src="../screenshots/device-info1.jpg" width="260" alt="Device info board page"></td><td><img src="../screenshots/device-info2.jpg" width="260" alt="Device info runtime page"></td></tr>
</table>

Device Info is a three-page read-only diagnostic surface covering firmware, display, board services, SD storage, runtime services, network, weather, alarm state, display zone, and temperature units.

Navigation: SELECT advances to the next page; hold BOOT returns.

### Environment

<table>
<tr><td><img src="../screenshots/environment.jpg" width="300" alt="Environment overview"></td><td><img src="../screenshots/environment1.jpg" width="300" alt="Environment sensor details"></td></tr>
</table>

Environment uses the SHTC3 sensor for temperature and relative humidity. SELECT opens sensor details; hold BOOT returns.

<table>
<tr><td><img src="../screenshots/motion.jpg" width="300" alt="Motion overview"></td><td><img src="../screenshots/motion-events.jpg" width="300" alt="Motion event diagnostics"></td></tr>
</table>

Motion uses the QMI8658 accelerometer and gyroscope. The overview shows live axes. Motion Events translates raw samples into debounced native events:

```text
TILT
SHAKE
ROTATE
LEVEL
```

The Motion Events screen exposes thresholds, debounce timing, counters, reset, and sensor details.

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Overview: SELECT | Open Motion Events |
| Motion Events: rotary up / down | Move through threshold and action rows |
| Motion Events: SELECT | Change threshold, reset counters, or open details |
| BOOT long | Return |

### Network and Wi-Fi transfer

<table>
<tr><td><img src="../screenshots/network.jpg" width="300" alt="Network overview"></td><td><img src="../screenshots/network-details.jpg" width="300" alt="Network details"></td></tr>
</table>

Network shows Wi-Fi, SNTP, SSID, IPv4 address, RSSI, provisioning details, regional timezone, RTC storage basis, and NTP server. The LAN Wi-Fi transfer portal is off until explicitly started.

Provision Wi-Fi in either of these first-class ways:

- **SD card:** put `/RUSTMIX/WIFI.TXT` on the FAT card (`ssid`, `password`, optional `timezone` / `ntp_server`) and boot. If the file is present and the station joins, the device stays on your home network.
- **SoftAP setup:** if `WIFI.TXT` is missing, station join fails, or you select **Configure Wi-Fi**, the e-paper shows AP `Rustmix-Setup` and `http://192.168.4.1`. Join that open network on a phone, open the URL, pick a scanned SSID (or type one), enter the password, and save. The device writes NVS and `WIFI.TXT` (when the card is present), then switches to STA. After it joins, Start Wi-Fi Transfer works as before.

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Rotary up / down | Move between transfer, Configure Wi-Fi, and details |
| SELECT on Start Wi-Fi Transfer | Start LAN portal and open portal status |
| SELECT on Stop | Stop active portal |
| SELECT on Configure Wi-Fi | Start SoftAP setup and show AP name + 192.168.4.1 |
| SELECT on Provisioning details | Open network details (WIFI.TXT path + SoftAP write-back) |
| BOOT long on setup | Return and keep the setup AP running |
| SELECT on Stop setup | Stop SoftAP (reconnects STA if credentials exist) |
| BOOT long | Stop active transfer portal when appropriate and return |

### Browser Wi-Fi transfer portal

<img src="../screenshots/wifi-transfer.jpg" width="520" alt="Rustmix Wave Wi-Fi transfer browser portal">

From a device on the same LAN, open the displayed URL and enter the six-digit session code. The portal lists the `/RUSTMIX` tree and supports bounded upload, download, rename, directory creation, and deletion operations while protecting internal configuration files.

### Weather

<table>
<tr><td><img src="../screenshots/weather.png" width="300" alt="Weather overview"></td><td><img src="../screenshots/weather-1.jpg" width="300" alt="Weather details"></td></tr>
</table>

Weather uses the configured Open-Meteo profile, bounded retries, and a last-known-good cache. The overview shows current conditions and a four-day forecast. Details show provider, timezone, observation time, last success, configuration file, and last error.

| Control | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Rotary up / down | Move between Refresh weather and Weather details |
| SELECT | Run the selected action |
| BOOT long | Return to Settings |

## 7. Power-key maintenance and sleep

A short Power press opens a display-maintenance menu from any ordinary UI route. Select **Clear ghosting now** to request the shared global-base refresh path. Select **Cancel** or hold BOOT to return without refreshing.

A long Power press enters sleep-image mode:

<img src="../screenshots/sleep.jpg" width="360" alt="Sleep image mode">

The firmware selects a random image from `/sdcard/RUSTMIX/SLEEP`, suspends network activity, sleeps the panel, retains the prior route, and uses a wake guard so the entry press is not mistaken for an immediate wake press.

## 8. Screenshot index

Every supplied screenshot is stored in the repository so the guide and README can link stable reference images.
